# Podswamp Examples

This project will create a set of Podswamp sites for some popular Podcasts with varying degrees of complexity. Some will be vanilla Podswamp sites, running from the bare bones configuration declarations; others will use title parsing declarations to produce guest pages or use custom templates and styles.

# The Podcasts
## Stop Podcasting Yourself
The popular Maximum Fun show features guest page configuration with vanilla styling.

## The Dead Authors
The now defunct Dead Authors Podcast also features guest page configuration.

## The Black Tapes
This Serial-inspired horror features custom templates and stying.

## Nightvale
This hugely popular comedy/horror show is a simple vanilla rollout.

# Building
If podswamp has already been installed, you can build all the Podcast sites by running the ```build.sh``` script.
